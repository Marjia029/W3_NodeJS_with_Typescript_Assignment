# Hotel Management API

## Overview

This project is a backend API developed using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to manage hotel details. The API allows users to interact with hotel data stored in JSON files. It supports operations such as retrieving, inserting, and updating hotel records, as well as uploading multiple images for hotels. The project also includes unit tests to verify the functionality of each endpoint.

## Features

- **POST /hotel**: Insert a new hotel record.
- **POST /images**: Upload multiple images for a hotel.
- **GET /hotel/{hotel-id}**: Retrieve detailed information for a specific hotel.
- **PUT /hotel/{hotel-id}**: Update an existing hotel's data.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** and **Express.js**
- **TypeScript** (optional but recommended for strict typing)
- **Jest** or **Mocha** for unit testing
- **Slugify** for generating slugs from hotel titles
- **Multer** for handling image uploads
- **VS Code** as IDE for building the project
- **POSTMAN** for request handling

## Schema
## Hotel Data Schema

Each hotel record is stored in a separate JSON file named `hotel-id.json`, where `hotel-id` is the unique identifier for the hotel. The hotel data follows this structure:

### Hotel Object

- **Hotel ID**: A unique identifier for the hotel (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`).
- **Slug**: A URL-friendly version of the hotel title, generated from the hotel title (e.g., "seaside-retreat").
- **Title**: The name of the hotel (e.g., "Seaside Retreat").
- **Description**: A short description of the hotel (e.g., "A luxurious hotel by the beach with breathtaking views.").
- **Guest Count**: The number of guests the hotel can accommodate (e.g., `150`).
- **Bedroom Count**: The number of bedrooms in the hotel (e.g., `75`).
- **Bathroom Count**: The number of bathrooms in the hotel (e.g., `75`).
- **Amenities**: A list of amenities offered by the hotel (e.g., `["Free Wi-Fi", "Outdoor Pool", "Spa"]`).
- **Host Information**: Information about the host (e.g., `Jane Doe, Owner, janedoe@example.com`).
- **Address**: The location of the hotel (e.g., `123 Seaside Blvd, Beach City`).
- **Latitude and Longitude**: Geographical coordinates of the hotel (e.g., `latitude: 34.0522`, `longitude: -118.2437`).

### Room Information

Each hotel contains multiple rooms, and each room has the following details:

- **Room Slug**: A unique identifier for the room, usually generated from the room title (e.g., `ocean-view-suite`).
- **Room Image**: The URL of the image representing the room (e.g., `https://example.com/images/room1.jpg`).
- **Room Title**: The name of the room (e.g., `Ocean View Suite`).
- **Bedroom Count**: The number of bedrooms in the room (e.g., `2`).
